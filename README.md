# Flappy-AI
This is a machine learning project I made and aims to help anyone who want to learn machine learning/AI.
This project implements Artificial Neural Network and Neuro Evolution. This project is inspired by 
Coding Train YouTube channel on their series making a flappy bird AI. I decided to make my own and
share it so that anyone who's interested in machine learning and wants to learn
will be helped.

DISCLAIMER: 
I am new to programming and doesn't have a lot of experiences
so there will be many errors and bad practices of how I am writing
my code. The codes of this project is intentionally not optimized
for the purpose of to be understandable by the begginers.
I made this project to be understandable to begginers and
optimization, cleaning etc. is not in mind in this project.

I am free to accept suggestions and corrections from the experts what ever you found bad things
in my code.
